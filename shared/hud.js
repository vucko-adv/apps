/**
 * The drawing engine, shared by every bimmer-lab app that draws through cluster-render
 * (robertnisipeanu/idrive-apps, native/cluster-render): it connects, builds the active layout's layers in
 * the active theme (one effect layer per shader widget, the image widgets packed into sheets, below), and
 * keeps live widgets updated from the kit's car.js.
 * Started by an app's main.js with the kit's ctx (settings, signals, log, spec, dataDir).
 * It lives in the repo's shared/ folder; app.json "shared" ships it with each app.
 *
 * Which display: app.json config.target, "hud" (800x480, the windshield HUD; the default) or
 * "panel" (1920x720, the whole instrument cluster, drawn over BMW's own gauges).
 * config.statusName names it on the status row ("HUD", "Cluster").
 * Which layout: with the "byMode" setting on and the car's drive mode known (FES
 * statusFESVehicleDynamicSwitchHMI), the "inComfort" / "inSport" / "inEco" setting; otherwise "hudLayout".
 * The layout name "off" draws nothing, so BMW's own HUD or cluster shows (and the other app can have the
 * shared scene: cluster-render never shows the HUD and the cluster panel at once). The two apps tell each other
 * what they show (screen.js): when the driver gives the screen to the other one (page.js asks first), this one
 * draws nothing until a theme or layout is picked on its own page again.
 * The colour theme is the layout's own "theme" when it has one (the cluster themes), else the "hudTheme"
 * setting (auto = Night after sunset).
 *
 * Effect shaders: cluster-render's v_uv has (0,0) at the TOP-left (PROTOCOL.md; confirmed on the car,
 * Nov 4 2026, when a box's header strip drew at the bottom). The bench draws the same way.
 *
 * Layer packing (Nov 5 2026): cluster-render draws at most 8 layers per client connection (its
 * CompositorLimits.per_client; 32 across all clients; a 9th is refused with "too many layers"), which the car
 * photos showed as a theme's shaders plus the first few text widgets. So the image widgets (text, scale, stripe, badge, gridlabels, icon, swatchimg) are
 * packed into SHEETS, one image layer per sheet, instead of one layer each. Widgets are grouped by
 * (class, z) and placed in file order: a widget goes into the first sheet of its group opened after every
 * earlier layer or widget its rect intersects (so an image widget never clobbers one it overlaps, and
 * file order still decides what is on top) AND whose union box with it stays within the sheet size limit,
 * else a new sheet is opened. A sheet's rect is the union box of its members (iw/ih that size). On create
 * every member is painted into a local buffer and the sheet is sent whole once (a 1920x720 RGBA whole write
 * is 5,529,600 bytes, under the 5,529,664 message limit; the client keeps its own whole copy); after that
 * every member update is a dirty rect of the sheet, translated by the sheet's offset (_blit; gridlabels
 * keeps its small-rects path). Effect widgets are one layer each, as before. An image widget with
 * "own": true gets its own layer as before (the calibration probes use it to count how many layers the car
 * draws).
 * Sheet size vs layer count: a rebuild re-sends every sheet whole, through the car's upload budget (floor
 * 2000 KB/s, ceiling 5500, the HUD gets at most half), so sheets are kept small: the limit starts at a
 * quarter of the target area (345,600 px on the panel, 96,000 on the HUD). If that needs more than
 * LAYER_BUDGET (8) layers in all (effects + own + sheets), the limit is doubled and the layout re-planned,
 * up to unlimited; if even unlimited needs more than 8, a warning says so and the layout is drawn anyway.
 * The rebuild log line names the layout, widget and layer counts, the limit used and the bytes of the
 * whole-sheet writes; the status row names the layer count, not the widget count; and two seconds after a
 * rebuild cluster-render's own status text is asked for and logged.
 *
 * Widget types (hud/layouts/*.json, or <data>/layouts/ overrides, see layouts.js):
 *   text      image layer; template tokens below, a font from hud/fonts, colour role
 *   scale     image layer; the shift bar's rpm numbers (0 .. bar max / 1000), evenly spread
 *   stripe    image layer; the M tricolour stripe
 *   shiftbar  effect layer; shaders.js shiftbar, lit by rpm, zones from the redline
 *   arc       effect layer; shaders.js arc, lit by a signal between min and max
 *   revbar    effect layer; shaders.js revbar, the G20-style slanted rev bar (Redline layout):
 *             "barH" bar height, "top" room for the marks above it, "slant" px, "over" rpm past the
 *             redline's thousand the scale runs to (1000: a 7000 redline gives 0..8)
 *   lights    effect layer; shaders.js lights, shift lights filling from "from" rpm (3000) up to the shift point
 *   badge     image layer; a rounded tag with text: "tone" verdict (the last shift's grade colour) or cold
 *   fill      effect layer; a solid colour (role "color", default "bg") over the whole widget, with an
 *             optional see-through "hole": [x, y, w, h] in target px, cut only while the bool setting
 *             "holeWhen" is on (true: always; the cluster's map window), shrunk by "holeInset" px on every side (6) with
 *             "holeRadius" px corners (28), so BMW's own cluster doesn't peek out at the window's corners.
 *             Opaque fill hides BMW's gauges under it.
 *   box       effect layer; a framed box: "fill" and "line" roles, "border" px, "radius" px, and a
 *             header strip "head" px tall in role "headColor" (its label is a text widget on top)
 *   mdash     effect layer; the M theme's whole backdrop (shaders.js mdash): "card" [x, yBottom, rBottom, rTop] (the
 *             left card, traced off the M8 photo: outer edge x, bottom y, the big round at the bottom outer corner, the
 *             rounding where the top curve meets the outer edge; the right card is its mirror), "cardTop" [a, b, c] (the
 *             card's top edge, y = a x^2 + b x + c), "cardCutR" [cx, cy, r] (the right card's lower outer corner cut on
 *             that circle, in the mirrored left frame), "cardFill" 0..1 (grey level, 0 = black: outline only), "blade" { xm, ym,
 *             kTop, kBot, round } (the left rev blade's outer edge, as mtach; the card ends "bladeGap" px before it),
 *             "line" [x0, y, x1, cap], "tyres" [cx, cy, scale] (the tyre block's car glyph and dividers; the eight
 *             readouts are text widgets with {{tyreP:FL}} .. {{tyreT:RR}} and {{u:pressure}}), "gaugeL" / "gaugeR" { cx, cy, r, (a dial as the M8's: a thin glass bracket whose outer edge is the circle cx, cy, r, lit from the bottom up to the value, drawn over the card; the right one is the left one's mirror)
 *             signal, min, max }, "mark" [x, y, scale], "segbars" [{ x, y, w, h, max, signal } x up to 4] (the
 *             setup level bars, "segSlant" px; the segment at round(signal) is red). Positions in target px.
 *   mtach     effect layer; the M rev bar: "side" left|right, "max" rpm, and in target px for the LEFT bar
 *             "y0" (0 rpm), "y8" (max), "ym" (the bend), "xm" (outer edge x at the bend; the right bar gives
 *             its own, mirrored), "kTop" / "kBot" (x per y px above / below the bend), "round", "wBot" / "wTop" / "wBend"
 *   sdash     effect layer; the whole Sport theme (shaders.js sdash): "geo" [yTop, yBend, yBottom, xBend] and
 *             "k" [above, below, round] for the left bracket's outer line (the right one is mirrored), "band"
 *             width, "inner" (the inner line's distance from the outer one), "scale" [y of 0, y of the top mark],
 *             "ticks" [speed, rpm], "rpmMax" (speed follows SPEED_SCALE), "fuelSeg" / "oilSeg" [fullX, fullY,
 *             emptyX, emptyY], "strip" [left end x, y, h, slant], "topEnd" x; the middle is black, and the map
 *             window is cut see-through while "holeWhen" is on ("hole", "holeInset", "holeRadius" as fill)
 *   segbar    effect layer; "max" segments, the first round(signal) lit (e.g. "setupLevel:engine"), "slant" px
 *   icon      image layer; a line icon from icons.js ("icon": gauge, shock, wheel, cog, stack, therm, oilcan, fuel)
 *   arc also takes "start" and "sweep" in degrees (clockwise from 12 o'clock; negative = anticlockwise)
 *   grid      calibration: effect layer of lines every "step" px (brighter every "major" steps)
 *   gridlabels  calibration: image layer, "x/y" at every "step" px (only the labels are uploaded)
 *   swatch    calibration: effect layer (calibration.js SWATCH), "steps" (11) grey steps 0..1 over the top
 *             half, four dark test colours over the bottom half
 *   swatchimg calibration: image layer, the identical picture painted into pixels (calibration.js
 *             swatchImage), so a photo of the two strips shows how the effect and image paths differ
 *   atext     effect layer (shaders.js atext): text drawn by the GPU from a glyph atlas, the probe for the path
 *             that needs no pixel writes. The font's glyphs go up once per connection as an R8 asset (one byte a
 *             pixel, not a layer, shared by every atext widget on that font); the widget is "cells" equal cells
 *             across its width ("w" / cells wide each; the glyphs keep their shape when w = cells x the font's
 *             widest advance and h = its cell height, logged at creation), and a new value is one uniform
 *             message of glyph codes. "text" tokens as text, "font", "color" role, "align" left | right | center.
 *             Up to 32 cells; only the characters the font has.
 *   dial      effect layer (shaders.js dial): a classic round gauge, the Roadster's: "measure" speed | rpm | signal ("signal",
 *             "max", "ticks"); speed reads 0..160 mph / 0..240 km/h (DIAL_SPEED, labels {{dial:speed:<i>}}), rpm 0.."max"
 *             (8000) with the red band from the redline (_redMarks) and the ring in the shift red at the shift point;
 *             "start" / "sweep" degrees (225 / 270), "minor" ticks per step (4), "ringW" px (14), roles "ring" (line)
 *             fading to "ring2" (dim), "tick" (fg), "needle" (hot), "face" (bg). The numbers are text widgets.
 *   meter     effect layer (shaders.js meter): a segmented bar, "signal" between "min" and "max" (raw units: km/h, C,
 *             bar, rpm), "segments" (20), "gap" px (4), "vertical": true fills upward; "colors" [3 roles] lit below
 *             "at"[0] / up to "at"[1] / past it (fractions of the bar), "trackColor" (track); "peak": ms (true = 3 s)
 *             holds the highest segment lit in "peakColor" (fg). arc takes "peak" too: a dot on the stroke.
 *   gmeter    effect layer (shaders.js gmeter): a G-meter: a bezel, rings every 0.25 g (0.5 g past 1.2 g) out to the
 *             setting "gRange" (1.2 g; the layout's "max" only when the setting is missing), the grip envelope (the
 *             furthest g this drive in 48 directions, role "envColor", fg), a trail of the last "gTrail" seconds (2;
 *             0 = none) and the dot: role "dot" (fg) under 0.5 g, amber to 0.8 g, the shift red past it; roles "line"
 *             (dim), "lineAlpha" 0-255 (150; 255 on the HUD, where see-through is faint). The dot moves the way the
 *             car accelerates (into the turn, up when speeding up), as cauliflowermossgrape's G-Force draws it; the
 *             settings "gFlipLat" (the car's left / right the other way round) / "gFlipLong" (brake on top) swap the
 *             drawing, a layout's "flipX" / "flipY" swap again. g is averaged over 150 ms and a sample over 3 g is
 *             dropped (also for the tokens). The envelope and the bests (tokens, the page's G-meter tab) last until
 *             resetG(), the app's restart or the switch between demo and car data.
 *   revarc    effect layer (shaders.js revarc): a segmented rev arc, the Rally theme's: centre "center" [x, y] (layer px, may
 *             sit below the layer), outer radius "r", "band" px (40), "start" / "sweep" degrees clockwise from 12 o'clock,
 *             "segments" (30); colours, flash and scale as the shiftbar.
 *   tiles     effect layer (shaders.js tiles): the Dyno theme's readout tiles in ONE layer: the background (role "color",
 *             bg) and up to 14 rounded tiles "tiles": [{ id, x, y, w, h (target px), slot, bar (false: none), toggle }],
 *             each with a thin "accent" strip on top and a bar along the bottom for its slot's sensor (TILE_BAR; zoned
 *             ones run "colors" [bar1, bar2, hot] split at "at" [0.6, 0.85], the rest all bar1). A tile turns role
 *             "warn" while its oil / coolant / boost reading is over the warning limit (put "warnFlash": false on
 *             its texts). Roles "fill" (panel), "line", "trackColor" (track); "radius" (8), "border" (1.5), "strip"
 *             (3), "barH" (6) px. The labels and values are text widgets on top.
 *   picture   image layer of its own: a picture from hud/pictures (pictures.js) as it is, "picture" its name; the
 *             widget's w / h must be the picture's. A theme drawn in a design tool is a picture (the face) under the
 *             live widgets (bimmer-lab-apps fork addition, Speed Meter theme)
 *   needle    image layer of its own: a needle picture (drawn pointing straight up) turned about "pivot" [x, y] (layer
 *             px from its top-left; else the picture's own px, py) by "measure" (speed in km/h, rpm, fuel 0..1, oil,
 *             coolant, or any _raw() name) through "table": [[value, degrees clockwise from 12 o'clock], ...] in
 *             rising value order (straight between points, held at the ends; no data: the first point). "glide": ms
 *             has the renderer play each turn over that long (cluster-render animations, untested on the car)
 *   segments  image layer of its own: a bar of segments that light one by one. "picture" is the bar with every
 *             segment lit (the widget's size); "segs" [[x, y, w, h], ...] each segment's box in it (widget px),
 *             first to light first; "steps" [v, ...] the value each segment lights at (segment i is lit while the
 *             value >= steps[i]); "measure" as a needle's (rpm, speed km/h, fuel 0..1, oil, coolant, any _raw()
 *             name). Unlit segments are see-through, so the face under it shows them dark. Only the segments that
 *             changed are sent (bimmer-lab-apps fork addition, Vintage theme)
 * Text widgets: "zeros": n pads a whole-number value with leading zeros to n digits ("000" km/h; fork addition).
 * Any image widget: "own": true gives it its own image layer instead of a place in a packed sheet (above).
 *   Pictures and segments get their own layer anyway, unless "own": false (fork addition): then they pack like
 *   text, so a face cut into its drawn pieces costs a few small sheets instead of a 1920x720 layer (11 MiB).
 * Any widget: "conn": 0..3 puts its layer (or its sheet) on that connection to cluster-render. The 8-layer limit
 *   is per connection, so a second socket from the same app gets another 8 (DukeAPenguin saw 28 layers over four
 *   sockets on his car, Nov 5 2026; the calibration grids probe it here: L5..L16 on connections 2..4). 0 (the
 *   default) is the app's own connection; a layout never asks for more than it needs, each extra one is opened
 *   on first use and named <app id>_<n>. Sheets never span connections.
 * Pixel memory: cluster-render has 16 MiB for every app's images together and counts each image twice
 *   (Compositor::add_image; a layer past it is refused with "the service's pixel memory is full"), so every
 *   image layer costs w*h*8 bytes. The rebuild log and the status row say what a layout costs.
 * Text and badge updates send only the one rectangle around the pixels that changed since the last paint
 *   (changes() below, after PenguinDukeYDAuto/idrive7-EVAHUD's eva_canvas.js, MIT): a 3-digit readout
 *   that goes 123 -> 124 sends its last digit, not the widget.
 *   boxes     effect layer; the GT3 dash's frame in ONE layer (shaders.js boxes; the car draws only a few effect
 *             layers): the background (role "color", default "bg") with the optional map "hole" as fill, and up to
 *             12 framed boxes "boxes": [{ id, x, y, w, h (target px), head (header strip px), border (2), radius
 *             (0), headColor "accent" (else the "head" role), toggle }]. Roles "fill" (panel), "line", "head",
 *             "accent" for all of them; the labels are text widgets on top. Sent as array uniforms (vec4 x 12).
 * Any widget: "toggle": "<bool setting>" hides it when that setting is off, "!<setting>" when it is on,
 * "<choice setting>=<value>" shows it only while that choice is picked (also with "!");
 * "mapUp" (toggle or holeWhen) is not a saved setting: on while the Waze map shows inside the theme (waze.js; the
 * "mapInTheme" setting); the map is a content z 0 layer, so a frame meant to sit over it is content z 1 or more.
 * "themes": [...] shows it only in those themes. Text "color2": a second role, the colour at the bottom
 * of the box (a top-to-bottom gradient, the chrome look). Text: "hotWhen": "now" turns it the shift red
 * at the shift point; "coldWhen": "cold" turns it blue while the cold guard lowers the shift point.
 * scale: "over" as revbar; "redFrom": true draws the numbers from the redline on in red.
 * lights: "count" (12), "from" rpm (3000) where the first light comes on, "tail" (0): the last "tail" lights are blue
 *   (the GT3 look); "round": true for dots;
 * "off" the alpha of an unlit light (0.14).
 * Text "warnFlash": false: no flash over the warning limit (a tile that turns red itself).
 * Text "colorBy": "verdict" colours it by the last shift's grade. Text "near": ["speed" | "rpm", i] turns it
 * "nearColor" (fg) while scale label i is the one nearest the value (BMW lights up the label by the needle).
 *
 * rpm is smoothed (a 120 ms filter, and the readout moves in 50 rpm steps only when it changes by 40 or
 * more), so idle wobble doesn't show, as on BMW's own tach. Shift scoring uses the raw rpm.
 * Boost: FES displayBoostPressure while it's valid, else (app.json config.dme) the engine unit over
 * read-only UDS, absolute pressure minus outside air pressure, as cauliflowermossgrape's car_vitals does.
 *
 * Text tokens: {{speed}} {{u:speed}} {{oil}} {{coolant}} {{boost}} {{u:boost}} {{rpm}}
 * {{gear}} (P / R / N, D3 / S3 / M3 by the shifter programme, or just 3 when the selector position is unknown), {{gearnum}} (3, or P / R / N)
 * {{spd:<i>}} (speed scale label i of SPEED_SCALE: 0..200 mph, 0..320 km/h) {{range}} {{u:distLc}} (mi, km) {{u:dist}} (MI, KM) {{ambient}} (outside, signed: +75) {{u:speedLc}} (mph, km/h) {{ampmLc}} (am, pm) {{torque}} {{u:torque}} (lb-ft, Nm) {{torquePct}} {{powerPct}} (% of config.engine's peak) {{boostHi}} {{boostMid}}
 * (gauge labels for 1.4 / 0.7 bar in the display unit) {{stage}} (P R N, D / S / M by the shifter programme) {{gearInD}} (gear number while in D) {{mode}} (COMFORT, SPORT, SPORT PLUS, SPORT INDIVIDUAL, ECO PRO, ...)
 * {{temp:<deg C>}} (that temperature in the display unit, °F rounded to 10, for gauge labels) {{setup:engine|chassis|steering|gearbox}} (what that part is set to in the drive mode now)
 * {{time}} {{ampm}} {{u:temp}} (°F / °C) {{gLat}} {{gLong}} (g, 2 decimals) {{gSide}} ("0.42 L", "0.42 R")
 * {{gFwd}} ("0.31 ACC", "0.31 BRK") {{gBest}} (the most g this drive) {{gMax}} (the G-meter's range, "1.2") {{signal:<car.data() key>}} (raw, 1 decimal).
 * Redline (shift_score.js): {{rpm10}} (rpm to 10) {{shiftAt}} {{lastShift}} {{lastGears}} (4 > 5)
 * {{verdict}} {{shiftPrompt}} (SHIFT at the shift point) {{coldNote}} (only while the oil is cold).
 * Units follow the "units" setting: us = mph, °F, psi; metric = km/h, °C, bar.
 * {{intake}} (intake air, from the engine unit: app.json config.dme.intake) {{boostPeak}} (the highest boost since the last
 * 0-60 run started) {{avgSpeed}} (average moving speed this drive, from its first minute) {{run}} (the 0-60 clock running, else the last time, s) {{runBest}} {{runState}} (READY / GO / DONE)
 * {{runLabel}} (0-60 MPH, 0-100 KM/H): runs.js. {{warm}}: WARMING UP while the oil is under 80 C, then ENGINE WARM.
 * {{badge}}: the model picked on the Badge tab (badges.js), "BMW X3 M40i" with the lettering on, '' for none.
 * Warnings: a text showing oil, coolant or boost (a {{oil}} / {{coolant}} / {{boost}} token, or a readout slot with that
 * sensor) flashes in the shift red while the value is over "warnOil" / "warnCoolant" (C) / "warnBoost" (bar); 0 = off.
 * Shift-light test (testShift(), the page's Alerts tab): for about 4 s the rpm every widget sees climbs from 1500 to just
 * past the shift point and holds there; only while the car stands. Shift scoring keeps the car's own rpm.
 * Night colours (Cluster Themes "nightDim" on Auto): after sunset (sun.js, at _sunPlace(): the time zone's middle) a layout's own theme is
 * built with its whites and greys at 60 %; the minute timer rebuilds at sunset and sunrise.
 *
 * Boost is a PUSH signal, not a diagnostic poll: tracing cauliflowermossgrape's
 * car_vitals showed its boost reading is de.bmw.infotainment.drivingexcitement.FES /
 * statusSwitchDriveDynamicSport2.displayBoostPressure, factor 0.01, offset 0,
 * invalid 255. car_vitals itself treats that field as unreliable on some cars, so
 * whether this X3 fills it is checked on the first drive. Reported here in bar.
 *
 * Never throws out of a timer or event: the kit turns an uncaught exception into an
 * app exit, and on the car a second unexpected exit uninstalls the app.
